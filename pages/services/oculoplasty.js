      question: "What are the problems faced by a patient with squint?",
      answer:
        "When the eyes are not aligned properly, each of the eyes is focusing on a different object and sends signal to the brain. These two different images reaching the brain lead to various problems that are different in children and adults. In children it can cause loss of depth perception (3D vision) and lazy Eye Disease (poor development of vision in the squinting eye). An adult canâ€™t ignore the image from either eye, and therefore they can have double vision. This can be very annoying and may interfere with work. Certainly loss of 3D vision and cosmetic deformity are also causes of concern.",
    },
    {
      question: "When should the squint be treated?",
      answer:
        "In a child, the treatment of squint and any associated amblyopia should be started as soon as possible. Generally speaking, the younger the age at which amblyopia is treated; the better is the chance of recovery of vision. Remember that the child would never grow out of squint. A delay in treatment may decrease the chances of getting a good alignment and the vision.",

In this article, I answer some of the frequently asked questions about eye floaters, so you know what to do if you start seeing floaters and whether to be concerned.

Have you ever noticed something drifting around your field of vision, but whenever you try to get a closer look it disappears, only to reappear as soon as you move your eyes? What you are seeing is a common phenomenon known as an eye floater.

Q1. What is an eye floater?
Eye floaters are small structures (clumps of protein) inside your eye that cause you to see spots, transparent blobs or tiny worm-like shapes drifting through your vision.
Floaters move around as you shift your glance and are most obvious when you are looking at a uniform, bright background such as a blank wall or clear blue sky.

Q2. What does an eye floater look like?
Floaters come in different shapes and sizes and you can have multiple floaters at once. People often describe their floaters as looking like black dots, hairs, cobwebs or even insects drifting around their vision. Some patients describe them as flying mosquito.

Q3. What causes eye floaters?
As you age, the vitreous gel may become more liquefied and develop stringy strands or clumps. When light passes through these clumps, they cast shadows on the retina, leading to the perception of floaters. Floaters may also be caused by other factors such as inflammation in the eye, bleeding, or retinal detachment.

Q4. Are eye floaters dangerous?
While floaters are generally harmless, they can be bothersome, especially if they interfere with your vision. Most people learn to ignore them over time as the brain adapts and filters them out. However, if you suddenly notice a significant increase in floaters, see flashes of light, or experience a loss of peripheral vision, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. These symptoms could be signs of a more serious condition, such as a retinal tear or detachment, which requires prompt treatment to prevent vision loss.

Q5. Do I need to get my eye floaters checked?
Because floaters can be a symptom of a potentially blinding condition, it is important that you have any new floaters examined to rule out a retinal tear or detachment. Make an appointment with your ophthalmologist.

Q6. Do eye floaters go away?
Eye floaters will not go away but u stop seeing them either because they have drifted out of view

title: 'Allergic Conjunctivitis'
excerpt: 'Allergic conjunctivitis, an inflammatory condition of the conjunctiva, is triggered by allergens like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander. Histamine release leads to red, itchy, and watery eyes. It can be seasonal (hay fever), perennial (indoor allergens), or giant papillary conjunctivitis associated with contact lens wear. Treatment includes allergen avoidance, lubricating eye drops, antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer eye drops, NSAID eye drops, and oral antihistamines if needed. Persistent or worsening symptoms warrant consultation with an eye care professional.'

Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory condition of the conjunctiva, which is the clear tissue that covers the white part of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelids. It occurs as a result of an allergic reaction to substances known as allergens.

Common allergens that can trigger allergic conjunctivitis include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold spores, and certain medications or cosmetics. When these allergens come into contact with the eyes, the immune system releases chemicals such as histamine, causing the blood vessels in the conjunctiva to become inflamed and the eyes to become red, itchy, and watery.

There are several types of allergic conjunctivitis, including:

1. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis: This type is most commonly associated with seasonal allergies, such as hay fever. It tends to occur during specific times of the year when certain allergens are prevalent, such as during spring or fall.
2. Perennial allergic conjunctivitis: Unlike seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, this type can occur year-round and is typically caused by allergens that are present indoors, such as dust mites, pet dander, or mold.
3. Giant papillary conjunctivitis: This form of allergic conjunctivitis is often associated with contact lens wear. It is characterized by the development of large bumps, called papillae, on the inner surface of the eyelids. These bumps can interfere with vision and cause discomfort.

The symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis may include redness, itching, tearing, swelling, a gritty sensation, and light sensitivity. In some cases, the allergic reaction may also affect the nose, leading to sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, and an itchy or sore throat.

Treatment options for allergic conjunctivitis include:

1. Avoidance of allergens: Minimizing exposure to known allergens can help prevent or reduce symptoms. This may involve keeping windows closed, using air purifiers, frequently washing bedding, and avoiding contact with pets or other triggers.
2. Artificial tears: Lubricating eye drops can provide temporary relief by moisturizing the eyes and washing away allergens.
3. Antihistamine eye drops: These over-the-counter or prescription eye drops help reduce itching and other allergic symptoms by blocking the effects of histamine.
4. Mast cell stabilizer eye drops: These eye drops help prevent the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from mast cells, providing long-term relief from symptoms.
5. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): In some cases, NSAID eye drops may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms.
6. Oral antihistamines: If the allergic conjunctivitis is accompanied by other allergy symptoms, such as sneezing or a runny nose, oral antihistamines may be recommended to provide overall relief.

If symptoms persist or worsen despite these measures, it is advisable to consult an eye care professional for a comprehensive evaluation and further treatment options.

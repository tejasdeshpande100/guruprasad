# Premium IOLs: Improved Vision Correction and Reduced Dependence on Glasses

Premium IOLs (Intraocular Lenses) are designed to provide improved vision correction and reduce the dependence on glasses or contact lenses after the surgery. They offer various features that address specific vision problems, such as presbyopia (difficulty focusing on close objects) or astigmatism (blurred vision due to irregularly shaped cornea).

There are different types of premium IOLs available, including:

1. Multifocal IOLs: These lenses have multiple focal points, allowing for clear vision at various distances, such as near, intermediate, and far. They can reduce the need for reading glasses or bifocals.

2. Accommodating IOLs: These lenses are designed to mimic the natural focusing ability of the eye. They can adjust their position within the eye to provide clear vision at different distances.

3. Toric IOLs: These lenses are specifically designed to correct astigmatism. They have different powers in different meridians of the lens, effectively compensating for the irregular corneal shape.

4. Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF) IOLs: These lenses provide an extended range of clear vision, from near to intermediate and sometimes far distances. They can reduce the need for reading glasses in most situations.

The choice of a premium IOL depends on factors such as your specific vision needs, lifestyle, and the recommendations of your eye surgeon. It's important to have a thorough discussion with your ophthalmologist to determine the most suitable option for you.

We can typically test you for cataracts, help you choose the best IOL for you, and schedule your cataract surgery within the same day.
